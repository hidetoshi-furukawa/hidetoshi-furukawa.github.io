Also called a secret-key algorithm.   Symmetric key A single cryptographic key that is used with a symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm, is uniquely associated with one or more entities, and is not made public (i.e., the key is kept secret). A symmetric key is often called a secret key. See Secret key.   Secret key A single cryptographic key that is used with a symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm, is uniquely associated with one or more entities and is not made public (i.e., the key is kept secret). A secret key is also called a Symmetric key.\nThe use of the term “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level but rather implies the need to protect the key from disclosure.   Public-key（asymmetric）cryptographic algorithm A cryptographic algorithm that uses two related keys: a public key and a private key. The two keys have the property that determining the private key from the public key is computationally infeasible.   Asymmetric key algorithm See Public-key cryptographic algorithm.   Key pair A public key and its corresponding private key; a key pair is used with a public-key algorithm.   Public key A cryptographic key used with a public-key cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with an entity and that may be made public. In an asymmetric-key (public-key) cryptosystem, the public key has a corresponding private key. The public key may be known by anyone and, depending on the algorithm, may be used, for example, to:\n1. Verify a digital signature that was generated using the corresponding private key,\n2. Encrypt keys that can be decrypted using the corresponding private key, or\n3. Compute a shared secret during a key-agreement transaction.   Private key A cryptographic key used with a public-key cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with an entity and is not made public.
